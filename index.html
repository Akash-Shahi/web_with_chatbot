            <h3>Anxiety & it's symptoms</h3>
            <p>
                Anxiety is a natural emotional response to stress or perceived threats, but when it becomes chronic or overwhelming,<br>
                it can lead to anxiety disorders. People with anxiety often experience excessive worry, fear, or nervousness that can<br>
                interfere with daily life. Anxiety is not just about feeling stressed—it can affect your physical, emotional, and behavioral well-being.
                <br><br>
                Common Symptoms of Anxiety:<br>
                Physical Symptoms:<br>
                Increased heart rate or palpitations: Feeling like your heart is racing or pounding.<br>
                Sweating: Excessive perspiration, especially in stressful situations.<br>
                Trembling or shaking: Uncontrollable shaking in the body, hands, or legs.<br>
                <br>
                Emotional Symptoms:<br>
                Excessive worry: Constantly worrying about things that may or may not happen, often without control.<br>

                Restlessness: A feeling of being on edge or unable to relax.<br>

                Irritability: Increased frustration or impatience, even over small matters.<br>

                Fear: A strong sense of fear, which might be linked to specific triggers (like social situations, public speaking, or flying).<br>

            <h3>Effects of Anxiety</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Physical Effects</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cardiovascular System:<br>

                    Increased heart rate and palpitations are common physical manifestations of anxiety. The body’s fight-or-flight response causes a surge of adrenaline, which can raise your heart rate.
                    <br><br>
                    Immune System:<br>

                    Chronic anxiety can weaken the immune system, making you more susceptible to infections, colds, or illnesses. The stress hormones released during periods of anxiety suppress immune function, leaving your body less prepared to fight off disease.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Mental and Emotional Effects</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cognitive Impairments:<br>

Difficulty concentrating: Anxiety can cloud your ability to focus, leading to problems with memory and attention. It’s common for individuals to feel like their thoughts are racing or "foggy."

Negative thinking: Anxiety can lead to a pattern of catastrophic thinking, where you imagine the worst possible outcomes, even in neutral situations.
                       <br><br>
                       Mood Changes:<br>

Anxiety is often accompanied by heightened irritability, frustration, or mood swings. Small issues can trigger emotional reactions that feel out of proportion to the situation.

Depression can sometimes accompany chronic anxiety, as both can reinforce each other. Feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope can lead to feelings of hopelessness or sadness.

            <h3>Ways to Prevent Anxiety & Tips to reduce Anxiety.

                    <h4>Ways to Prevent Anxiety</h4>
                    <p>
                        Exercise Regularly:<br>
Physical activity is one of the most effective ways to reduce anxiety. Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood elevators that reduce stress. It also helps lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

<br>Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days, such as walking, jogging, yoga, or swimming.
<br><br>
Maintain a Healthy Diet:<br>
Eating a balanced diet can positively influence your mood and energy levels. Avoid excessive caffeine, sugar, and processed foods, as they can increase anxiety or trigger mood swings.

<br>Focus on whole foods: fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Stay hydrated, as dehydration can also affect mood.
<br><br>
Get Enough Sleep:<br>
Poor sleep can contribute to higher levels of anxiety. Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep each night.

<br>Stick to a regular sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day.

                    <h4>Tips to reduce Anxiety</h4>
                    <p>
                        Practice Mindfulness:<br>
Mindfulness involves paying attention to the present moment without judgment. It helps you become more aware of your thoughts, feelings, and body sensations without getting overwhelmed by them.

<br>You can practice mindfulness through activities like deep breathing, meditation, or body scanning. Apps like Headspace or Calm can guide you through mindfulness exercises.
<br><br>
Deep Breathing and Progressive Muscle Relaxation:<br>
Deep breathing exercises, such as diaphragmatic breathing, can activate your body's relaxation response, lowering heart rate and promoting calm.

<br>Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) involves tensing and then relaxing muscle groups in the body to help release physical tension caused by anxiety.
<br><br>
Try Guided Meditation:<br>
Meditation is an excellent way to manage anxiety. It helps quiet your mind and build emotional resilience. You can find many guided meditation resources online or in apps.

<br>Focus on breathing, repeating a calming mantra, or imagining peaceful scenes to reduce anxiety.
